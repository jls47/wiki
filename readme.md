Overview

This is my capstone project.  It's a wiki made using the Django framework, with Python as the primary language.  It functions sort of like a CMS; you can write and update entries with a rich text editor that allows you to customize your article to your heart's content.


Tech

The wiki is built using Django and all the features that come with it (templating engine, server tools, etc.), which also includes Python, HTML, and CSS.
