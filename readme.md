This is my capstone project.  It's a wiki made using the Django framework, with Python as the primary language.  

To build the wiki, I used PyCharm by JetBrains for programming and editing, DigitalOcean for hosting, cmder for a console, and github.  Version control was accomplished using github.  For local testing, I used Django's default "runserver" command and google chrome.

I have also started tracking the site with google analytics, to see how successful users are in writing, editing, and creating accounts so that in the future I might design such crucial functionality better.  

I hope you like this site as much as I do!  Check it out at wiki.jlukes.co!
